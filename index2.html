          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">I am a programmer who recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp and is looking to bring my passion for Web Development to an environment where I can continue my learning journey and grow as a professional. I currently specialize in building web applications with the Ruby on Rails framework and also have extensive experience in Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3, but am looking forward to finding an environment where I can expand my horizons and soak up additional prgramming languages.</p>

                    <p class="left-align light">
            I originally began my career as a freelance performing artist in New York City after graduating from college from University of North Carolina School of the Arts with a BFA in Contemporary Dance, and was fortunate enough to work with a variety of creative and talented artists as well as self-produce my own shows on a number of occasions. Throughout this time I took on many jobs outside of my main roles as dancer and choreographer in order to ensure that a production will run smoothly. However, after seven years I have begun to crave a change in pace which is what prompted me to transition into the field of Web Development. 
          </p> 

          <p class="left-align light">
            I pride myself on being an extremely hard-working individual and am never satisfied with my work unless it is my absolute best. I also believe that my background as a performing artist gives me a unique creative outlook on coding and web development and also has helped shape my work ethic in a way that I am never satisfied unless I have done my absolute best with my work. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions for me.

                  <br> EngageMe is a Ruby on Rails app built along with two other collaborators as our final project at Dev Bootcamp. It is a presentation analytics tool that allows users to analyzes a live video feed of their audience during a presentation to determine and categorize the emotions being manifested in real-time in response to your presentation content. Once users have captured the real-time emotional responses to their content, the analytics suite will help them track how the audience responded to their content and delivery. Users can compare results across presentations and gain new perspective into common emotional themes.

                  <br> This website was built to promote myself as a freelance choreographer. Ever since I took an evening refresher course in HTML and CSS a several years ago, I've been wanting to have an example of my work with cleaner coding with more of an emphasis on using CSS to structure the layout and a more practical design. It is still very much a work in progress and I will continue to update and develop it as I have time.
