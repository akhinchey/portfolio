				<b>- Title:</b> Amanda Hinchey & Dancers Homepage
				<br>
				<b>- Date Created:</b> July 2015
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>- Description:</b>
				<br> I built this website recently to promote myself as a freelance choreographer and it is currently the only active and working site in this portfolio. Ever since I took an evening refresher course in HTML and CSS a couple of years ago, I've been wanting to have an example of my work with cleaner, up-to-date coding with more of an emphasis on using CSS to structure the layout. The design is also more practical and minimal. It is still very much a work in progress and I will continue to update and develop it as I have time.

				<b>- Description:</b>
				<br> This is a layout I created for an online contest back when I was in college. It was a chance for me to use all sorts of crazy photoshop filters since it wasn't being designed for any sort of professional use.

				<br>
				<b>- Date Created:</b> 2004
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>- Description:</b>
				<br> By the time I took my first web design class in high school, I had already taught myself the basics that the other students were learning. So, the teacher gave me the chance to redesign our school's extremely outdated homepage. I wasn't given complete control, as there were a few graphics such as the black logo and the school's mission statement that I was required to use and the way the links were organized also had to stay the same. The school wound up keeping this layout for several years after I graduated.

				<br>
				<b>- Date Created:</b> 2004 (?)
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>- Description:</b>
				<br> This is a simple layout based on a random topic that I threw together in my high school web design class. For fun, I just updated the info on the front page since by coincidence it looks as though they will be changing the test again in the near future. Even though I think the design is a little plain Jane now, I wanted to include an example of my early work where I kept things pretty minimal with Photoshop.
