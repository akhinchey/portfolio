						<b>- Title:</b> EngageMe
						<br>
						<b>- Date Created:</b> November 2016
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>- Description:</b>
						<br> EngageMe is an app that I helped build along with two other collaborators as our final project at Dev Bootcamp. It is a presentation analytics tool that allows users to analyzes a live video feed of their audience during a presentation to determine and categorize the emotions being manifested in real-time in response to your presentation content. Once users have captured the real-time emotional responses to their content, the analytics suite will help them track how the audience responded to their content and delivery. Users can compare results across presentations and gain new perspective into common emotional themes.

						<br>
						<b>- Description:</b>
						<br> A chess logic puzzle as seen in the computer game, "The Seventh Guest". A single player wins when they have placed eight chess queens on the board without having any of them attack each other. Players place queens on the board by clicking on a specific square, and the most recently-placed queen will knock off any queens in its path no matter how many.

						<b>- Title:</b> Amanda Hinchey & Dancers Homepage
						<br>
						<b>- Date Created:</b> July 2015
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>- Description:</b>
						<br> I built this website recently to promote myself as a freelance choreographer and it is currently the only active and working site in this portfolio. Ever since I took an evening refresher course in HTML and CSS a couple of years ago, I've been wanting to have an example of my work with cleaner, up-to-date coding with more of an emphasis on using CSS to structure the layout. The design is also more practical and minimal. It is still very much a work in progress and I will continue to update and develop it as I have time.

					<b>- Date Created:</b> June 2008
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>- Description:</b>
					<br> This is a layout I created for an online contest back when I was in college. It was a chance for me to use all sorts of crazy photoshop filters since it wasn't being designed for any sort of professional use.

			 		<b>- Title:</b> Homepage for My Old High School
					<br>
					<b>- Date Created:</b> 2004
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>- Description:</b>
					<br> By the time I took my first web design class in high school, I had already taught myself the basics that the other students were learning. So, the teacher gave me the chance to redesign our school's extremely outdated homepage. I wasn't given complete control, as there were a few graphics such as the black logo and the school's mission statement that I was required to use and the way the links were organized also had to stay the same. The school wound up keeping this layout for several years after I graduated.

			 		<b>- Title:</b> The New SAT - Sample Work from High School
					<br>
					<b>- Date Created:</b> 2004 (?)
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>- Description:</b>
					<br> This is a simple layout based on a random topic that I threw together in my high school web design class. For fun, I just updated the info on the front page since by coincidence it looks as though they will be changing the test again in the near future. Even though I think the design is a little plain Jane now, I wanted to include an example of my early work where I kept things pretty minimal with Photoshop.
