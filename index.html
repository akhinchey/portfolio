						<b>- Title:</b> EngageMe
						<br>
						<b>- Date Created:</b> November 2016
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>- Description:</b>
						<br> EngageMe is a Ruby on Rails app built along with two other collaborators as our final project at Dev Bootcamp. It is a presentation analytics tool that allows users to analyzes a live video feed of their audience during a presentation to determine and categorize the emotions being manifested in real-time in response to your presentation content. Once users have captured the real-time emotional responses to their content, the analytics suite will help them track how the audience responded to their content and delivery. Users can compare results across presentations and gain new perspective into common emotional themes.

						<b>- Title:</b> Amanda Hinchey & Dancers Homepage
						<br>
						<b>- Date Created:</b> July 2015
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>- Description:</b>
						<br> This website was built to promote myself as a freelance choreographer. Ever since I took an evening refresher course in HTML and CSS a several years ago, I've been wanting to have an example of my work with cleaner coding with more of an emphasis on using CSS to structure the layout and a more practical design. It is still very much a work in progress and I will continue to update and develop it as I have time.

					<br>
					<b>- Date Created:</b> 2004
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>- Description:</b>
					<br> By the time I took my first web design class in high school, I had already taught myself the basics that the other students were learning. So, the teacher gave me the chance to redesign our school's outdated homepage. I wasn't given complete control, as there were a few graphics such as the black logo and the school's mission statement that I was required to use and the way the links were organized also had to stay the same.
